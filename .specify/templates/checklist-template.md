# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

**Purpose**: A structured verification list used to ensure correct implementation, testing, and integration of the requested feature.
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md or relevant documentation]

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on:

- Shadow Swap feature requirements
- World-switch mechanic context
- `plan.md` and `tasks.md` information
- Unity technical constraints

All items below must be replaced with concrete tasks during generation.

## World-System Requirements

- [ ] CHK001 — Feature correctly responds to world-switch event from `ShadowWorldManager`
- [ ] CHK002 — Object behavior in Real world verified
- [ ] CHK003 — Object behavior in Shadow world verified
- [ ] CHK004 — Feature has one clear, readable state in each world
- [ ] CHK005 — No visual artifacts or popping during world switching
- [ ] CHK006 — Layer assignment (Real / Shadow) is correct and consistent

## Unity Implementation

- [ ] CHK007 — Prefab created, clean, and self-contained (no missing references)
- [ ] CHK008 — Script placed in the correct folder (`Player`, `World`, `Systems`, etc.)
- [ ] CHK009 — Public parameters exposed in `ScriptableObject`s (if applicable)
- [ ] CHK010 — All serialized fields are properly documented
- [ ] CHK011 — No magic numbers; all tunable values are externalized
- [ ] CHK012 — Physics layers and collisions tested in both worlds

## Gameplay Verification

- [ ] CHK013 — Feature supports mechanical clarity (easy to understand)
- [ ] CHK014 — Feature introduces no unfair difficulty
- [ ] CHK015 — Interaction with player movement verified
- [ ] CHK016 — Works with existing enemies, hazards, and platforms
- [ ] CHK017 — Cannot be exploited or bypassed by switching too fast/slow
- [ ] CHK018 — Behavior is deterministic (same result every time)

## Performance & Stability

- [ ] CHK019 — World-switch update takes <1ms
- [ ] CHK020 — No excessive `Update()` logic (use events instead)
- [ ] CHK021 — No memory allocations during gameplay
- [ ] CHK022 — No console errors or warnings
- [ ] CHK023 — Feature behaves consistently after scene reload

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] CHK024 — Tested in at least two prototype levels
- [ ] CHK025 — Verified behavior under rapid switching (spam test)
- [ ] CHK026 — Verified behavior under slow/intentional switching
- [ ] CHK027 — Negative tests: incorrect world, player not present, disabled component
- [ ] CHK028 — All edge cases covered
- [ ] CHK029 — Test screenshots / video recorded for documentation

## Documentation & Integration

- [ ] CHK030 — Added to `spec.md`
- [ ] CHK031 — Added to `plan.md` with task breakdown
- [ ] CHK032 — Added to `tasks.md` with acceptance criteria
- [ ] CHK033 — Commit message references checklist ID (e.g., "Implements CHK010-CHK016")
- [ ] CHK034 — Feature added to Development Guidelines → Recent Changes
- [ ] CHK035 — Added to level design guidelines if it affects gameplay

## Notes

- Check off items as work progresses: `[x]`
- Add comments, test results, or references inline
- Never leave sample items in final generated checklist (command must override)
